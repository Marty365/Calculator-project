# Calculator-project
The project aim is to create a simple calculator that children aged 4-11 can use to learn simple mathematic arithmetic. In particular addition, subtraction, division and multiplication. In the future the plan will be for the calculator program to be further developed to be used by youth older than 11 and for additional functionalities to be added.
